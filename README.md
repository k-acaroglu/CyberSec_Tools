# All the cybersecurity tools I've written so far
Feel free to go in the individual directories and explore!
  
It should be noted, however, that I did rewrite some code and am aware that all this code could be optimized to make fully functional tools.
The main reason why I didn't bother with this is because I wanted to prioritize learning and not waste time doing similar processes on each program.

> Note: All of them so far were written thanks to the online Udemy course made by Zaid Sabih/ZSecurity.
